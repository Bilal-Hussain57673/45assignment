// Q12 - Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
// answer:
var names = ["ali", "farhan", "sabir", "junaid"];
for (var _i = 0, names_1 = names; _i < names_1.length; _i++) {
    var name_1 = names_1[_i];
    console.log("hello ".concat(name_1, ", could you please teach me some typescript tooic ?"));
}
