//Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.

//Add one new guest to the middle of your array. â€¢ Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.

//Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

// answer:
let guests:string[]=["miss minaheel","sir hamza syed","sir zia"]
console.log("great news ! i found a bigger dinner table");

guests.unshift("sir mudassir")
guests.splice(guests.length/2,0,"sir asharaib ali")
guests.push("sir bilal")

guests.forEach(guest=>{
    console.log(`dear ${guests}, would you like to join me for dinner`);
    
})
