// Q12 - Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

// answer:
let names:string[]=["ali","farhan","sabir","junaid"]
for(let name of names){
    console.log(`hello ${name}, could you please teach me some typescript tooic ?`);
    
}
